Installation
*****************

1. Download the latest version of the Java PathFinder core (jpf-core) from the JPF website (http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf/wiki/install/start). You should choose to download and build JPF from the Mercurial source repository; the provided binary snapshots are for an older version of jpf-core that is not compatible with Basset. The following instructions assume that you will use default directory locations when installing JPF.

mkdir ~/projects/jpf
cd ~/projects/jpf
hg clone http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/hg/jpf/jpf-core

2. Download the latest version of the Basset extension (jpf-actor) from the JPF source repository.

cd ~/projects/jpf
hg clone http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/hg/jpf/jpf-actor

3. Make sure to create a JPF site.properties file in your ~/.jpf directory as directed in the jpf-core installation instructions. Add the location of the jpf-actor extension to this file. If you have not previously used JPF, your site.properties file should look something like:

jpf.home = ${user.home}/projects/jpf
jpf-core = ${jpf.home}/jpf-core
jpf-actor = ${jpf.home}/jpf-actor
...
extensions=${jpf-core}

4. Build the projects:
Use ant to build the jpf-core and jpf-actor projects. 

cd ~/projects/jpf/jpf-core
bin/ant
# ... lots of output, at the end you should see something like:
# BUILD SUCCESSFUL
cd ~/projects/jpf/jpf-actor
bin/ant
# ... lots of output, at the end you should see something like:
# BUILD SUCCESSFUL
