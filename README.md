This repository contains information related to the tool Basset, a tool for systematic testing of JVMbased
actor programs.

The tool was originally presented in this [Paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1882349) at Foundations of Software Engineering, 2010.

This repository _is not_ the original repository for this tool. Here are some links to the original project:
